# Write a program to create a dictionary with all numbers from 1 to 15 as the keys and their squares as the corresponding values.
# d={}
# for x in range(1,16):
#     d[x]=x**2
# print(d)

# Q3.Write a Python script to generate and print a dictionary that contains a number (between 1 and n) in the form (x, x*x).
# Sample input ( n = 5) :
# Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}.
n=5
d={}
for i in range(1,6):
    d[i]=i**2
print(d)

# Q10.Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are square of keys. 
# Sample Dictionary
# {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}

# Q4. Write a Python script to print a dictionary where the keys are numbers    between 1 and 15 (both included) and the values are square of keys.
# Simple Output : {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81, 10: 100, 11: 121, 12: 144, 13: 169, 14: 196, 15: 225}.
